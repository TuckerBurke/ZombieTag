## About
Simulation of flocking (separation, alignment, and cohesion) along with pursue, evade, and wander. 
Created in Unity Engine with C#. I'm pretty happy with the balance of forces in this simulation.
It looks genuinely organic. I will revisit this project with 3D flocking for sure. You can
test it out for yourself [here](http://tuckerburke.com/Retro-Future-Lorenz-Attractor/).
